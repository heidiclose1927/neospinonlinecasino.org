                            <h2 class="mt-5">1. Our Commitment to Responsible Gambling</h2>

                            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Preventing Underage Gambling:</strong> We strictly prohibit individuals under the age of 18 from participating in any gambling activities on our site.</li>
                                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Preventing Problem Gambling:</strong> We provide tools and resources to help players manage their gambling habits and prevent the development of problem gambling.</li>
                                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Promoting Awareness:</strong> We aim to raise awareness about problem gambling and provide information on where to seek help.</li>
                                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Ensuring a Safe Environment:</strong> We strive to create a secure and responsible gaming environment for all our <span class="accent-keyword">neospin casino online</span> users.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2 class="mt-5">2. Identifying and Preventing Underage Gambling</h2>
                            <p>To prevent underage individuals from accessing our <span class="accent-keyword">neospin online casino</span> :</p>
                            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Age Verification:</strong> We implement robust age verification procedures during the registration process. All players are required to declare they are over 18 years of age and provide valid identification.</li>
                                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Account Suspension:</strong> Accounts found to belong to underage individuals will be immediately suspended, and any winnings will be forfeited.</li>
                                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Parental Controls:</strong> We encourage parents and guardians to use filtering software to prevent minors from accessing gambling websites.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2 class="mt-5">3. Tools for Responsible Gambling</h2>
                            <p>We offer the following tools to help our <span class="accent-keyword">neospin casino online</span> players manage their gambling:</p>
                            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Deposit Limits:</strong> Players can set daily, weekly, or monthly deposit limits to control the amount of money they spend. These limits can be adjusted at any time; however, any increase in limits will typically take effect after a cooling-off period to allow for careful consideration.</li>
                                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Loss Limits:</strong> Players can set limits on the amount of money they can lose over a specific period.</li>
                                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Session Limits:</strong> Players can set a time limit for their gaming sessions to help manage the duration of their play.</li>
                                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Self-Exclusion:</strong> For players who feel they need a break from gambling, we offer a self-exclusion option. This allows you to exclude yourself from playing on neospinonlinecasino.org for a set period (e.g., 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, or permanently). During this period, you will not be able to log in to your account, deposit funds, or receive any marketing communications.</li>
                                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Cool-Off Period:</strong> A short-term break option for players who want a temporary pause from gambling without full self-exclusion.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="mt-4"><strong>How to Set Limits or Self-Exclude:</strong></p>
                            <p>You can usually find these options within your account settings under a "Responsible Gambling" or "My Limits" section. If you need assistance, please contact our customer support team.</p>

                            <h2 class="mt-5">4. Recognizing Problem Gambling</h2>
                            <p>Problem gambling can have severe consequences for individuals and their families. While most people gamble responsibly, it's important to be aware of the signs of problem gambling. These may include:</p>
                            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                                <li class="mb-2">Spending more money and time gambling than you can afford.</li>
                                <li class="mb-2">Chasing losses, trying to win back money you've lost.</li>
                                <li class="mb-2">Gambling affecting your work, relationships, or financial situation.</li>
                                <li class="mb-2">Feeling restless or irritable when trying to cut down or stop gambling.</li>
                                <li class="mb-2">Hiding the extent of your gambling from others.</li>
                                <li class="mb-2">Borrowing money to gamble or to pay gambling debts.</li>
                            </ul>
